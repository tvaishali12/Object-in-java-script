    //Q-Why object are faster than array?

    // objects are faster then array b/c ,in objects it becomes very easy to get the any value
    //from object ,by using their key name but, in case of array, if we have to get any value so
    // we have to rember the index of that value,which is very difficult when we have
    // a huge amount of data.
    // that is why objects are mostly used rather then array.

    //example:--
    //array--
    let array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
    console.log("array", array[5]);
    //if we have to get the 5 from array so it is neccessary to rember the index which is
    // very difficult in case of large amount of data

    //object--
    const myProfile = {
      name: "Vaishali",
      city: "bhopal",
      state: "MP",
      isActive: true,
      isPresent: {
        present: "yes",
        notPresent: "no",
      },
    };
    // it is very easy in objects to get any value just using their keys
    console.log("object", myProfile.isActive);
  </script>
